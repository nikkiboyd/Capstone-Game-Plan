Lizard Wizard

For my capstone, I am hoping to make a React or Angular app for users who own reptiles. I’m imaging that this app will be used as a tool to help track and monitor their pet’s care and spot trends in behavior.

As an MVP, I am hoping that users will be able to do the following:

- Create a new reptile entry; allow there to be multiple pets
- Have different tabs to view overall history and log important routine events to Firebase database (feeding, cleaning, shedding, light bulb status, substrate change, and more).
- Receive alerts (not sure what medium is feasible for MVP yet) when an event is due for user’s attention. Think this is really important for overall purpose of app.

Want to have’s:
- User account and authentication through Firebase
- Computer push alerts as a first choice
- Implement as a progressive web app
